# Data Science In Python 

Data science, also known as data-driven science, is an interdisciplinary field of scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured, similar to data mining.


Cover some of the most used python packages in the field of Data Science. A very effective overview on Jupyter notebook , Numerical Python , Matplotlib , Pandas , NLTK , Sci-Kit and lots of real time ongoing projects and famous data sets recorder in kaggle.
